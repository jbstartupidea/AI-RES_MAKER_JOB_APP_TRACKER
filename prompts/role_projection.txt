You are projecting experience into a TARGET ROLE.

STRICT RULES:
- Role title MUST be the target role
- NEVER output QA, DevOps, Analyst roles
- Map systems → AI Engineer responsibilities
- AI = applied systems, orchestration, decision logic
- Mixed domains allowed

Output JSON ONLY:

{
  "role_title": "AI Engineer",
  "experience": [
    {
      "domain": "",
      "responsibilities": []
    }
  ]
}
